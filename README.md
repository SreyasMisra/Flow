# Flow

-Problem- Pipe leakage poses a major issue in water transportation. Current methods of identifying leakage, which analyze consumer usage data, are inconclusive, leaving the source of pipe failure still a mystery.

-Solution- Flow enable stakeholders on the utilities side to visualize existing pipe networks and identify points of leakage down to the single pipe. After inputting flow data history, Flow is able to pinpoint average water loss along the pipes of a network. Users are then able to input flow data on a daily, weekly, etc. basis to compare it against the water loss norm, enabling Flow to highlight specific pipes within a network that exhibits abnormal water loss.
